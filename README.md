# Bicycle Sales Analysis: Customer Profile and Preferences
**Bicycle Sales Analysis: Customer Profile and Preferences**

When we take a look at the customer data analysis of a bicycle sales company, we obtain interesting and instructive results. This analysis helps us better understand the company's marketing strategies based on various factors such as customers' demographic characteristics, income status, regions of residence, and bicycle usage preferences.

**Data Cleaning and Classification**

Starting the analysis, after cleaning up repeated and missing data in the dataset, we updated abbreviations to make the data more understandable. Then, we classified the age data based on age ranges: young, middle-aged, and elderly.

**Income and Gender**

Firstly, we examined income levels by gender. We observed that the majority of high-income customers are male. Additionally, we found that the likelihood of purchasing a bicycle increases as income levels rise.

**Usage Distance**

The usage distance of bicycles as a means of transportation has a significant impact on sales. Our analysis shows that the likelihood of purchasing a bicycle decreases as the distance increases. However, we identified that customers prefer bicycles for distances between 2-5 miles. Therefore, we believe offering motor-assisted bicycles to customers for long distances could be beneficial.

**Age and Preferences**

In our analysis by age groups, we identified that middle-aged customers prefer using bicycles. Hence, it's important to consider assisted bicycle options for elderly customers as well.

**Marital Status and Sales**

In our analysis by marital status, we found that single customers decrease our sales. It's important to develop options or innovations where bicycles can be used as a means of socialization for this customer group.

**Conclusion**

Overall, our analysis defines the preferred customer base for our sales as middle-aged, high-income customers living within a distance of less than 5 miles. We observe that among potential customers, there are young and middle-aged single individuals.

Understanding customer preferences and shaping marketing strategies accordingly is critical for success in bicycle sales. Our analysis will help the company better understand its target audience and guide its marketing efforts more effectively.
